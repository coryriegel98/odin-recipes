# odin-recipes

This project is the application of HTML concepts that I have learned 
from the HTML section of The Odin Project. These concepts consisted 
of the HTML boilerplate, important elements, lists, links and images,
and general best practices when structuring HTML pages.

The first iteration of this project will include an index page as the
homepage for a recipe website that list relative links to different
recipes on other HTML pages.
